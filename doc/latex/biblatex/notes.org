* Abstract LOS
** http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29122/how-to-get-abbreviations-of-the-bibliography-into-the-list-of-shorthands
** TODO shorthand occurs a lot in biblatex.def
** DONE search for "los"
** TODO Big comment block
** TODO skiplos option (in biber too) -> skipbiblist
** DONE Need to make the name of the biblist available in .bcf so it can be arg to \sortlist. label->sortscheme, add listname
** DONE 938 - \blx@warn@losempty needs changing
** DONE 5659 - sortscheme names for shorthands needs generalising
** DONE 5712/5716 - Where shorthand sortschemes are checked
** DONE 5800 - def of \key. @shorthand@ to @#1@ so that type of sortlist is actually used.
** TODO 5893 - bibenv def for shorthands
** DONE 5984 - Start of \printshorthands options. This needs to be generalised
** DONE 6687 - def of \printshorthands
** TODO 6764 - \AtBeginShorthands/\AtEveryLositem - how do we generalise these?
** TODO 6795 - Change default driver name?
** TODO skipbiblist calls \blx@bbl@shorthand which isn't relevant in general any more
** DONE 9906 - Message needs changing in deprecation of sortlos
** DONE skiplos option needs warning to skipbiblist
** TODO \blx@defbibstrings has los stuff hard-coded in
** TODO \blx@xml@slist and \blx@xml@slistlos can probably be combined

A biblist is different from a bibliography in that every entry is printed
using the same driver rather than one dictated by the entry type

biblist name determines:
sortscheme name
driver name
biblist filter name
heading localisation string name
