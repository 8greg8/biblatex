* Abstract LOS
** http://tex.stackexchxange.com/questions/29122/how-to-get-abbreviations-of-the-bibliography-into-the-list-of-shorthands
** DONE shorthand occurs a lot in biblatex.def
** DONE search for "los"
** DONE skiplos option (in biber too) -> skipbiblist
** DONE Need to make the name of the biblist available in .bcf so it can be arg to \sortlist. label->sortscheme, add listname
** DONE 938 - \blx@warn@losempty needs changing
** DONE 5659 - sortscheme names for shorthands needs generalising
** DONE 5712/5716 - Where shorthand sortschemes are checked
** DONE 5800 - def of \key. @shorthand@ to @#1@ so that type of sortlist is actually used.
** DONE 5893 - bibenv def for shorthands
** DONE 5984 - Start of \printshorthands options. This needs to be generalised
** DONE 6687 - def of \printshorthands
** DONE skipbiblist calls \blx@bbl@shorthand which isn't relevant in general any more
** DONE 9906 - Message needs changing in deprecation of sortlos
** DONE skiplos option needs warning to skipbiblist
** DONE \blx@xml@slist and \blx@xml@slistlos can probably be combined
** DONE \blx@defbibstrings has los stuff hard-coded in (losname which is also in biblatex.def. Probably need legacy aliad for losname)
** DONE Big comment block
** DONE Missing sortscheme should default to global, if same named does not exist
** TODO Add label to biber test .bcfs
** TODO \AtBeginShorthands/\AtEveryLositem are legacy aliases - document \AtBeginBiblist/\AtEveryBiblistItem
** TODO Document \DeclareBiblistFilter and compare with \defbibfilter. You do want to filter biblists at source
** TODO doc of \printshorthand throughout doc
** TODO Document that sorting scheme for biblists defaults to biblist name, then global. Beware that global may not contain any sorting instructions for fields not in the sortscheme and nothing will be output.
** TODO Document incompatible change of bib env shorthands->shorthand and driver shorthands->shorthand
** TODO document bib headings default to biblist name for printbiblist
** TODO document default for bibheading is "biblist" which uses \biblistname macro
** TODO \losname is now \biblistname

A biblist is different from a bibliography in that every entry is printed
using the same driver rather than one dictated by the entry type. Also
usually filtered at source.

biblist name determines

default for sortscheme name
default for list environment name "+s"
biblist filter name (\DeclareBiblistFilter)
driver name
