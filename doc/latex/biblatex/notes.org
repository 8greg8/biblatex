* Abstract LOS
** http://tex.stackexchxange.com/questions/29122/how-to-get-abbreviations-of-the-bibliography-into-the-list-of-shorthands
** DONE shorthand occurs a lot in biblatex.def
** DONE search for "los"
** DONE skiplos option (in biber too) -> skipbiblist
** DONE Need to make the name of the biblist available in .bcf so it can be arg to \sortlist. label->sortscheme, add listname
** DONE 938 - \blx@warn@losempty needs changing
** DONE 5659 - sortscheme names for shorthands needs generalising
** DONE 5712/5716 - Where shorthand sortschemes are checked
** DONE 5800 - def of \key. @shorthand@ to @#1@ so that type of sortlist is actually used.
** DONE 5893 - bibenv def for shorthands
** DONE 5984 - Start of \printshorthands options. This needs to be generalised
** DONE 6687 - def of \printshorthands
** DONE skipbiblist calls \blx@bbl@shorthand which isn't relevant in general any more
** DONE 9906 - Message needs changing in deprecation of sortlos
** DONE skiplos option needs warning to skipbiblist
** DONE \blx@xml@slist and \blx@xml@slistlos can probably be combined
** DONE \blx@defbibstrings has los stuff hard-coded in (losname which is also in biblatex.def. Probably need legacy aliad for losname)
** DONE Big comment block
** DONE Missing sortscheme should default to global, if same named does not exist
** DONE Add label to biber test .bcfs
** DONE document label attr in datamodel macros
** DONE doc of \printshorthand throughout doc
** DONE \AtBeginShorthands/\AtEveryLositem are legacy aliases - document \AtBeginBiblist/\AtEveryBiblistItem
** DONE Document \DeclareBiblistFilter and compare with \defbibfilter. You do want to filter biblists at source
** DONE Document that sorting scheme for biblists defaults to biblist name, then global.
** DONE Document incompatible change of bib env shorthands->shorthand and driver shorthands->shorthand
** DONE document default for bibheading is "biblist" which uses \biblistname macro
** DONE refs to \DeclareBiblistFilter (ZZ)
* omitnumbers generally will make numeric-comp.cbx die because it needs labelnumber to exist for some tests. This is not really a bug.
* general flow for defernumbers
