* NOTES
** DONE Need to turn off redef warnings for xparse
** TODO Check all occurences of \print{field,list,name} in biblatex.def?
** TODO Same for styles ...?
** DONE Need warning for form/lang variants of lists/names with different listtotals (in biber)
** DONE index isn't creating everything yet? Check against 1.5 or bibtex
** DONE replace listargsl with listargs
** DONE when done check all occurrences of abx@{field,list,name@}
** DONE @TE stuff - when done, do we still need ifbibfieldms (probably).
** DONE How do the changed macros fare in etoolbox boolean tests?
** DONE If names aren't multiscript in custom data models, they are undef
** DONE Some problem with related fields - clear* are clearing global
** DONE form/lang should be global and per-entry, passed in bcf. Then biber uses the active form/lang and only omits these for .bbl when the same.
** DONE What does the language field do? clearlang? (standard.bbx print the LANGUAGE field - that's what these macros are for - irrelevant for ms)
** DONE Changed names of form/lang things breaks apa test
** DONE getlang - needs counters for abx@forms@<field> and abx@langs@<field>@<form> - shouldn't be global as it's per entry?
** TODO Make new form/lang coutners public
* Documentation
** Babel adjusts to lang of fields (hyphens, shorthands, extras, just hyphens if lang isn't loaded)
** Biber makes sure that lang isn't present as option for fields where the lang matches the hyphenation field
** Assume in standard styles that there is only one lang variant?
** Multiscript fields. Combination of form/lang is a variant
** field and field_x_y - where x and y are defaults - overwrite
** global multiscriptform option - multiscriptlang comes from language/babel option
** \cite* forms/langs are determined by \DeclareLabelalphaTemplate, \DeclareLabelname and \DeclareLabeltile. Need to declare a new cite command with appropriate form/lang in \print* for others
** clear* are special loops
** save* are special loops, (\macro<form><lang>)
** restore* are special loops, (\macro<form><lang>)
** DM needs documenting so people can tell what ms fields are
** \if{field,list,name}sequal are special - doc how
** indextitle doc - copies \blx@multiscriptform/\blx@languagename to indextitle
** \iffieldint doesn't work in \ifthenelse and never did (ok in \ifboolexpr+test)
** \ifbibfieldform{bibfield}{<form>} (if there is a <form> for bibfield?)
** \ifbibfieldlang{bibfield}{<form> or nothing}{<lang>} (if there is a <lang> for <form> for bibfield?)
** \ifbibfieldms{bibfield} - is a MS field?
** \ifbibfieldvariants (Are there any forms/langs variants other than orig_default for bibfield?)
** \loopforms, \looplangs and \loopvariants (loop over all forms/langs doing macro for each)
