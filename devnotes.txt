Pattern types need to be implemented in biber (gender) with validation
(put pattern in blx-dm.def)

Re-write intro to 2.2.1, say this is the default data model etc.

special data types from bib:fld:spc - Some don't need to go in the
data model, this needs documenting. Only things which make it into
main biber loop need to be in data model so they have a handler. IDS
does not as it's consumed during driver processing.

Variable type fields? (2.2.1)

Document datepart datatype (biber internal)

Macro to delete datamodel elements
Document data model macros
Set internal dm in bltx from datamodel
