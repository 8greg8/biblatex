Current .bcf does not validate. Either:
* no presort/sortexludes in non-global sorting
* Use list specific presort/sortexcludes (needs to be done in biber)
* Move presort/sortexcludes outside of sorting

probably option 3 as the macros for these in biblatex are not inside
sorting spec anyway.

user override of default driver map spec doesn't work. Need a loop
over explicit valid drivers, overwriting names cs and then afterwards,
append them all to blx@biber@sourcemap

Need to try to indent sorting spec more for lists.
