refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.

sortlos option should be removed - sorting spec on shorthand lists is as
  per normal sorting scheme defs. No scheme is by shorthand (shorthand
  scheme from .def). Changed in docs

These all use the global sorting scheme (document this)
\bibbysection
\bibbysegment
\bibbycategory

section="" must come before sorting="". It is mentioned in the manual but
should be explicitly mentioned for sorting.

Need to try to indent sorting spec more for lists.
