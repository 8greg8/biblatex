refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.

labels for lists should be sorting scheme. We need to generate in
biber all mentioned scheme sorts within a refsection and name these
lists with the label coming from the .bcf (which will be the sort
scheme name passed to \printbibliography)
\printbibliography should write lists to .bcf with type=entry

1. When no bib data, add sorting scheme name (or 'GLOBAL') to a list
   of list labels for type entry
2. When bib data, output list with correct type and deref sorting
   scheme name and add to XML


Then do something similar for \printshorthands
\printshorthands should write lists to .bcf with type=shorthand
