refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.


Check all @entry@\blx@sorting - should they all be global sorting spec?

sortlos option should be bibtex only - for biber, sorting spec on shorthand lists is as
  per normal sorting scheme defs. No scheme is by shorthand (shorthand
  scheme from .def). Change in docs. Perhaps I took out some bibtex sortlos
  from .sty? Compare with 1.7.

These all use the global sorting scheme (document this)
\bibbysection
\bibbysegment
\bibbycategory

section="" must come before sorting="". It is mentioned in the manual but
should be explicitly mentioned for sorting.

Need to try to indent sorting spec more for lists.
