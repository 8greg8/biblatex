refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.

labels for lists should be sorting scheme. We need to generate in
biber all mentioned scheme sorts within a refsection and name these
lists with the label coming from the .bcf (which will be the sort
scheme name passed to \printbibliography)
\printbibliography should write lists to .bcf with type=entry

Deal with no sorting specified

Then do something similar for \printshorthands
\printshorthands should write lists to .bcf with type=shorthand and needs
filter lines in XML
