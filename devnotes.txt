refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.

labels for lists should be sorting scheme. We need to generate in
biber all mentioned scheme sorts within a refsection and name these
lists with the label coming from the .bcf (which will be the sort
scheme name passed to \printbibliography)

Need to try to indent sorting spec more for lists.


Conditionalise \blx@bbl@sectionlist on #2=shorthand and then for #2=entry,
need to populate whatever refsection{} currently does.

Need to populate cses with @<sortscheme> and pick this out from tempc in \print*

sortlos option should be removed - sorting spec on shorthand lists is as
per normal sorting scheme defs (probably define one for this in biblatex.def)

Remove legacy MAIN/SHORTHAND commented in biber
