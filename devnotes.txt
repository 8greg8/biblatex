refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.

labels for lists should be sorting scheme. We need to generate in
biber all mentioned scheme sorts within a refsection and name these
lists with the label coming from the .bcf (which will be the sort
scheme name passed to \printbibliography)




sortlos option should be removed - sorting spec on shorthand lists is as
  per normal sorting scheme defs. No scheme is by shorthand (shorthand
  scheme from .def)
Remove legacy MAIN/SHORTHAND commented in biber
Remove trace package from .sty

These all use the global sorting scheme:
\bibbysection
\bibbysegment
\bibbycategory

section="" must come before sorting="". It is mentioned in the manual but
should be explicitly mentioned for sorting.

If no printbibliography, no shorthands normally?


Stop it breaking the .bcf on second run

Auctex is not auto-running biber? Message issue?

Need to try to indent sorting spec more for lists.
