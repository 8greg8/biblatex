refsegments are synatactic filtering based on place where citations
occur relative to the segment declarations. Other filters are
semantic. So in biber, we only care about refsections as
labels/counters are reset for many things between refsections.


In bcf, sectionlists are independent of refsections
In bbl, they are contained in refsections, this is probably wrong
because it doesn't work with lists which are not refsection specific.
Should be sortlist, not sectionlist througout.

* Don't filter on section in biber, output \sortlist{type}{label}
  which includes every key in all refsections


Need to try to indent sorting spec more for lists.
